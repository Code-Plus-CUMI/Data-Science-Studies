#	** Steps Statistical Analysis **
# 	********************************
#
# - Import the necessary libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
# and statsmodels;
#
# - Use the describe() function to generate summary statistics for all
# numerical columns in the dataframe;
#
# - Use the value_counts() function to generate a frequency count
# for all categorical columns in the dataframe;
#
# - Use the groupby() function to generate statistics for specific
# combinations of categorical columns and numerical columns;
#
# - Use the pandas corr() function to compute pairwise correlation
# of columns, excluding NA/null values;
#
# - Use the chi-squared test of independence to test for association
# between categorical columns;
#
# - Use a t-test or ANOVA to test for differences in means between
# groups defined by categorical columns;
#
# - Use regression analysis to model the relationship between numerical
# columns and a categorical or numerical target column;
#
# - Use machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest,
# or neural network to predict a target column based on the other 
# columns in the dataframe;
#
# - Visualize the data using Matplotlib or Seaborn library to get
# a better understanding of the distribution of the data and
# relationships between variables.
